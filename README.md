# dungeoncrawler
A small dungeon crawler with loot, enemies, and labyrinths. 

This program is very barebones and is awaiting more functionality.
Plans include implimenting static map designs, better button input, greatly
improved graphics and full loot with in depth character stat and attack system
all in ASCII. Although there are plans in the far future to eventually implement
a gui version of the game with proper graphics. That's more of a maybe however...
